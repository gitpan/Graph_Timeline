module and some sample data.

INSTALLATION

TEST FAILURES

The tests are there to make sure that I have broken nothing when I
fiddle with the code and will teach you very little about how to use
the code. 

TO DO

  1971 accepted for 'start' and 'end' dates for intervals and points.
* Get Graph::Timeline::GD to render points.
* Documentation

BUGS

None so far

REQUIREMENTS
